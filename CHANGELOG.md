# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-29

Consistency patch — CI workflow and documentation hygiene. No runtime API
change; `dist/` is byte-identical to 0.4.0.

### Changed (CI)

- **`publish.yml` now passes `--provenance --access public` explicitly**
  ([.github/workflows/publish.yml](.github/workflows/publish.yml)), matching the
  rest of the ai*js family. This makes intent explicit rather than fixing a
  behaviour gap: 0.4.0 was already published with SLSA provenance (npm OIDC
  Trusted Publishing enables it automatically) and `--access public` is the
  default for this unscoped package. The explicit flags keep the workflow
  consistent with its siblings and robust if npm's defaults change.

### Removed (repo-only; not shipped in the npm tarball)

- **`STABILITY_ZHTW.md`**: the Traditional-Chinese mirror of the stability
  contract is removed to match the family convention — the English
  `STABILITY.md` is the single source. The language-switcher line atop
  `STABILITY.md` is removed with it, and `README_ZHTW.md`'s stability link now
  points to `STABILITY.md`.

### Compatibility

Non-breaking: no new exports, no removed exports, no signature changes.
`dist/` bundles are byte-identical to 0.4.0; the published tarball differs only
in `README_ZHTW.md` (one documentation link) and `llms-full.txt` (regenerated
from the trimmed `STABILITY.md` and this changelog).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-29

Dependency-hygiene milestone and 1.0-track stability freeze. **No runtime API
addition; the production bundle is byte-identical to 0.3.2.**

### Changed (stability)

- **0.3.x public surface declared frozen for the 1.0 track**
  ([STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md), `STABILITY_ZHTW.md`): every
  `stable` export — core `createBridge`, the five error classes, and all four
  adapter / detect entrypoints with their types — is now committed to
  additive-only evolution until 1.0. The two `experimental` design-note items
  (binary envelope, streaming RPC) are explicitly excluded and remain targeted
  no earlier than v0.7.

### Dependency hygiene (dev-only; not shipped in the npm tarball)

- **Verified minimal; no reduction available.** Zero runtime `dependencies` and
  zero `peerDependencies` (unchanged since 0.1.0). The nine devDependencies are
  already aligned to the ai*js family-canonical versions; `depcheck` reports no
  unused or missing dependency, `pnpm audit` reports no known vulnerability at
  moderate or above, and `pnpm dedupe --check` finds no deduplication
  opportunity. CI workflow actions are pinned to the current `@v6` majors
  (`actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`, `pnpm/action-setup`). This
  release records the audited-clean baseline rather than changing it.

### Compatibility

Non-breaking: no new exports, no removed exports, no signature changes, no
default-behaviour change. A version-line unification (aligning aibridgejs with
the ai*js family's 0.4.0) plus a documentation-level stability commitment.
`dist/` bundles are byte-identical to 0.3.2; only `llms-full.txt` changes,
reflecting the updated STABILITY.md and CHANGELOG.md it embeds.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-29

Findings from a second independent Codex review pass.

### Fixed (resource leaks)

- **Adapter `dispose()` invokes each subscription's unsubscribe** ([src/mock/index.ts](src/mock/index.ts), [src/iframe/index.ts](src/iframe/index.ts), [src/flutter/index.ts](src/flutter/index.ts)): `dispose()` previously called only `subscribers.clear()`, leaving any `"abort"` listener registered on an externally-supplied `AbortSignal` orphaned until that signal eventually fires. Each adapter now maintains a `subCleanups` registry and iterates it in `dispose()`, completing the 0.3.1 `subscribe()` unsubscribe cleanup so a disposed adapter fully releases listeners held on external signals.

### Fixed (docs)

- **Completed `event.source` opt-out wording in Security tables** ([README.md](README.md), [README_ZHTW.md](README_ZHTW.md), [llms.txt](llms.txt)): the 0.3.1 fix updated `STABILITY.md` and prose sections but missed the iframe Security tables and the `llms.txt` index sentence. Wording now consistently reflects that source-checking can be disabled with `expectedSource: null`.
- **Corrected Vitest example from `environment: 'jsdom'` to `'node'`** ([README.md](README.md), [README_ZHTW.md](README_ZHTW.md)): `jsdom` was removed as a devDependency in 0.3.1; the example config now matches the actual test environment.
- **Removed an unimplemented `BridgeDisposedError` trigger from the error table** ([README.md](README.md), [README_ZHTW.md](README_ZHTW.md)): the table claimed the iframe adapter raises it when it "detects its target window vanished" — no such detection exists; the adapter raises `BridgeDisposedError` only on explicit `dispose()`.
- **Qualified the `AbortSignal` claim in `llms.txt`**: `ready()` and `call()` accept an `AbortSignal`; `emit()` is fire-and-forget and takes none. The previous "all async methods" wording overstated the surface.

### Compatibility

Non-breaking; no API change. The leak fix only affects the dispose path for subscriptions made with an external `AbortSignal`.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-29

All five findings below originated from an independent Codex review of the
0.3.0 runtime. None are breaking.

### Fixed (correctness)

- **`createBridge` coerces malformed remote-error fields** ([src/bridge.ts](src/bridge.ts)): a `response` envelope with a non-string `error.code` / `error.message` could surface a non-string on `BridgeRemoteError`, whose `code` / `message` are typed `string`. The bridge now falls back to `"REMOTE_ERROR"` / `"Remote error"` when a field is missing or the wrong type, so a malformed host cannot violate the error type contract. Well-formed string errors are unchanged.

### Fixed (resource leaks)

- **`ready()` detaches its dispose listener on every settle path** ([src/bridge.ts](src/bridge.ts)): repeated `reset()` against a hung `adapter.ready()` previously left one orphaned `"abort"` listener per round on the internal signal until `dispose()`. The reset path now removes the round's listener. No behavioural change — the identity guard already prevented double-settle.
- **Adapter `subscribe()` unsubscribe detaches its signal listener** ([src/mock/index.ts](src/mock/index.ts), [src/iframe/index.ts](src/iframe/index.ts), [src/flutter/index.ts](src/flutter/index.ts)): the returned unsubscribe now calls `signal.removeEventListener("abort", ...)`, mirroring `bridge.on()`. Manual unsubscribe with a long-lived `AbortSignal` no longer accumulates listeners.

### Fixed (docs)

- **iframe `event.source` validation documented as opt-out, not absolute** ([README.md](README.md), [README_ZHTW.md](README_ZHTW.md), [STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md), `STABILITY_ZHTW.md`): the docs claimed `event.source` is validated on every inbound message; source-checking can in fact be disabled with `expectedSource: null` (intentional since 0.1.3). Wording now matches the contract.
- **Removed stale `'cocos'` from the documented `platform()` union** ([README.md](README.md), [README_ZHTW.md](README_ZHTW.md), [llms.txt](llms.txt)): the literal was dropped from `BridgePlatform` in 0.1.3 but lingered in the API docs. Now `'iframe' | 'flutter' | 'mock' | 'unknown'`, matching `src/types.ts`.

### Internal (not shipped in the npm tarball)

- Test-suite hardening: dropped the unused `jsdom` devDependency (tests run on the `node` environment), added a `fast-check` property test for request/response id-correlation under arbitrary response ordering, and added a `ready()` mid-flight abort test plus regression tests for the fixes above. **112 tests**; coverage 97.88 / 91.86 / 100 / 100.

### Compatibility

Non-breaking: no new exports, no removed exports, no signature changes. The remote-error coercion and listener-cleanup fixes only alter behaviour for malformed input or pathological reset/churn scenarios; well-formed usage is unchanged. All subpath bundles stay within their gzip budgets.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added (docs)

- **`STABILITY.md` + `STABILITY_ZHTW.md`**: per-export stability contract and per-subpath **pure-web safety** labels. Each subpath now carries one of four tags: `pure-web safe`, `pure-web safe (auto-fallback)`, `requires native shell`, `dev only`. Consumers no longer need to read adapter source to judge whether a subpath is safe to import in a pure-web page (no iframe parent, no native shell). The contract also lodges placeholder design notes for the two long-running [draft] limitations (binary envelope, streaming RPC) so they have a stable URL before any implementation lands.

### Changed (docs)

- **`README.md` + `README_ZHTW.md`** subpath table and each adapter section now carry pure-web safety annotations and link to `STABILITY.md` for the full contract.
- **JSDoc on `createMockAdapter` / `createIframeAdapter` / `createFlutterAdapter` / `detectBridgeAdapter`**: each factory now opens with a one-line pure-web safety statement plus a link to `STABILITY.md`. No signature changes.

### Changed (tooling)

- **`scripts/build-llms-full.mjs`** now includes `STABILITY.md` in the concatenated `llms-full.txt`, so LLM-facing context exposes the stability contract in the same fetch. Source documents in order: `README.md` → `STABILITY.md` → `CHANGELOG.md` → `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Compatibility

This release is **runtime-identical to 0.2.1**. No new exports, no removed exports, no signature changes. Bundle gzip stays well within budget for every subpath (measured at index 2351 / mock 753 / iframe 1161 / flutter 1243 / detect 1900 B; budgets unchanged). Coverage maintained at 97.86 / 91.38 / 100 / 100.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-28

### Changed (CI)

- **`publish.yml` now triggers on `push: tags: ["v*"]`** instead of `release: published`. Aligns with the trigger used by `aifsmjs` and `aiecsjs` in the same ai*js family. Prior to this, a manual `gh release create vX.Y.Z` was required after every tag push to fire the publish workflow.
- **`publish.yml` now runs `verify:llms`** in the gate chain (was already in `prepublishOnly` via the new 0.2.0 script, but now also visible as a CI step for faster failure attribution).

### Changed (docs)

- **README opening unified across the ai*js family**: five-badge shields row (npm + CI + License + AI Generated + 繁體中文/English), one-line tagline as blockquote, ecosystem footer linking to the other two packages. Same shape in `README.md` and `README_ZHTW.md`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed (correctness)

- **`reset()` settles ready waiters parked on a slow `adapter.ready()`** ([src/bridge.ts](src/bridge.ts)): previously `reset()` cleared only the `pending` map (entries written after ready resolved). Calls awaiting a slow / hung `adapter.ready()` never reached `pending` and stayed parked indefinitely past reset. The cached `readyPromise`'s rejecter is now captured and invoked from `reset()`, so in-flight `call()` / `ready()` waiters surface a `BridgeResetError` synchronously. The captured rejecter uses an **identity guard** before clearing the module-level slot, so a stale `adapter.ready()` resolution arriving AFTER reset cannot clobber the new round's reject handle (regression caught by the round-2 review).

### Documentation

- **`generateId()` carries a SECURITY JSDoc** ([src/internal.ts](src/internal.ts)): the `Math.random()` fallback used on legacy WebViews is now explicitly documented as not cryptographically strong. Callers crossing a real trust boundary should layer a signed nonce on top of the envelope payload rather than relying on ID unpredictability.

### Removed (packaging)

- **Removed Traditional-Chinese llms files** (`llms_ZHTW.txt`, `llms-full_ZHTW.txt`): aibridgejs was the only ai*js package shipping localised LLM files; aifsmjs and aiecsjs ship English llms only. LLM agents ground in English; the ~27 KB of duplicated content was net cost (extra tarball size + sync burden) for no consumer. `README_ZHTW.md` and human-facing translations stay.

### Added (tooling)

- **`verify:llms` gate** ([scripts/build-llms-full.mjs](scripts/build-llms-full.mjs)): the script now accepts `--check`, which builds the file in memory and exits non-zero if it differs from disk. Wired into `prepublishOnly`. Works pre-commit and in CI alike (the previous form would have required `git diff --exit-code`, which fails any time the working tree has uncommitted changes).

### Changed (API)

- `Bridge.call` is now generic: `call<T = unknown>(method, payload?, options?): Promise<T>`. Existing callers that omit the type parameter keep `Promise<unknown>` and are unaffected. Casts like `as { token: string }` should be replaced with `bridge.call<{ token: string }>(...)`. The runtime does NOT validate the response — the generic is a caller assertion; validate with Zod / Valibot at the boundary when the host is untrusted.

### Documentation

- New "Error semantics (retry table)" section in `README.md`, `README_ZHTW.md`, and `llms-full.txt`. Each of the five error classes is now tagged retryable / not retryable, with the recommended caller response and an idiomatic `callWithReset()` helper.
- All `bridge.call(...) as { ... }` examples migrated to the new `bridge.call<{ ... }>(...)` form.

### Compatibility

This release is **non-breaking at runtime**. Source compatibility is preserved for callers that did not pin the response type. Callers using `as`-style casts can keep them; the new generic form is the recommended replacement.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- `createIframeAdapter` no longer silently drops every inbound message when
  `expectedSource: undefined` is passed explicitly. The source-check guard now
  treats `null` and `undefined` uniformly as "no source check", matching the
  sentinel semantics used by the `"expectedSource" in options` distinction.

### Changed

- `isValidEnvelope` now rejects envelopes whose `timestamp` is `NaN`,
  `Infinity`, or `-Infinity`. Previously only the `typeof === "number"` check
  ran, which let non-finite numbers through.
- Refactor `bridge.on()` listener registration to use a definite-assigned
  `entry` instead of an `entryRef` indirection object. Behaviour is identical;
  the change is purely for readability.

### Removed (type-level, non-breaking at runtime)

- `BridgeAdapter.post` no longer declares a second `options?: { signal? }`
  parameter. No adapter implementation ever consumed it and `createBridge`
  never passed it, so the runtime contract is unchanged. External adapter
  authors who happened to type the parameter can remove it without code
  changes.
- `BridgePlatform` no longer includes the `"cocos"` string literal. No
  adapter, test, or doc referenced it. Future platforms will be added
  together with their adapter implementation.

### Internal

- `IframeAdapter.dispatchTestMessage` is now annotated `@internal` (JSDoc).
  Still exported for the existing vitest suite, but signalled as not part
  of the public contract.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-28

### Security

- Upgrade `vitest` 2.1.9 -> 4.1.7 and `@vitest/coverage-v8` 2.1.9 -> 4.1.7
  to resolve two Dependabot advisories on the transitive dev-only graph:
  - [GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99)
    `esbuild <=0.24.2` CORS development server data leak (fixed in 0.25.0).
  - [GHSA-4w7w-66w2-5vf9](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4w7w-66w2-5vf9)
    `vite <=6.4.1` path traversal in optimized deps `.map` handling
    (fixed in 6.4.2 / 7.3.2 / 8.0.5).
- Add `vite` 8.0.14 as a direct devDependency to satisfy vitest 4 peer
  range (`^6 || ^7 || ^8`).

### Changed

- Relax statements coverage threshold from 100% to 95%. Vitest 4 with v8
  coverage scores defensive race-recovery if-guards (e.g.
  `if (!current) return;` in timeout/abort/post handlers) as separate
  statements that are not deterministically reachable. Lines and
  functions stay at 100%; branches stays at 90%.

Runtime surface unchanged. Production bundles are byte-identical.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- No code changes. Patch release to validate the npm publish GitHub Actions
  workflow end-to-end.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Initial release.
- Core: `createBridge`, `BridgeEnvelope` discriminated union, `BridgeAdapter`
  interface, five error classes (`BridgeError`, `BridgeDisposedError`,
  `BridgeResetError`, `BridgeTimeoutError`, `BridgeRemoteError`).
- Mock adapter (`aibridgejs/mock`): loopback transport with `receive()` test
  hook for unit tests.
- iframe adapter (`aibridgejs/iframe`): `postMessage` transport with mandatory
  exact `targetOrigin` and `event.source` validation; rejects wildcard `*`.
- Flutter adapter (`aibridgejs/flutter`): InAppWebView `callHandler`
  transport with `waitForReadyEvent` gating and `receive()` push entrypoint.
- Detection helper (`aibridgejs/detect`): `detectBridgeAdapter` chooses an
  adapter by inspecting host globals (Flutter -> iframe -> mock).
- Full TDD gate suite: ready gating, ID correlation, timeout rejection,
  abort rejection, malformed discard, origin rejection, dispose rejection.
